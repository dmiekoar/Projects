# Welcome to my github!


This repository contains some projects I've developed within the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence field. More specifically, you can expect to find projects  on one or more of the following topics:
  * Data Cleaning
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Feature Engineering
  * Predictive modeling
  * Data Visualization

I expect to contribute with spreading  knowledge capable of helping people make better decisions using data-driven approach, as well as enable the creation of new technological solutions for different kinds of problems you might have.

Here is a list of some projects you find here:
